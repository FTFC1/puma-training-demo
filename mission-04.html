<h1>Mission 4: "I'll Think About It"</h1>
<div class="meta">
    ⏱️ Time: 7-9 minutes &nbsp;|&nbsp; 🎯 How to handle the most common objection without being pushy (and when to let them go)
</div>

<h2>⚠️ THE PROBLEM</h2>
<p>You did everything right:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Made eye contact in 5 seconds ✅</li>
    <li>Approached at the right time ✅</li>
    <li>Asked great questions ✅</li>
    <li>Listened more than you talked ✅</li>
    <li>Showed them exactly what they need ✅</li>
</ul>
<p>Customer nods. They examine the product. They seem interested.</p>
<p>Then they say: <strong>"Let me think about it."</strong></p>
<p>And they leave.</p>
<p>What just happened?</p>
<p><strong>You lost the sale.</strong> Because "I'll think about it" is almost never about thinking. It's about escaping.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>💰 WHY THIS COSTS YOU SALES</h2>
<p><strong>Reality check:</strong> 9 out of 10 customers who say "I'll think about it" never come back.</p>

<div class="highlight">
    <strong>Here's the math:</strong><br>
    • 5 customers/day say "I'll think about it"<br>
    • 1 returns = 4 lost sales/day<br>
    • 4 lost sales × 6 days = 24 lost sales/week<br>
    • 24 × ₦25,000 average basket = <strong>₦600,000/week</strong><br>
    • <strong>₦31.2 million/year</strong> walking out your door<br><br>
    Not because the product is wrong. Not because the price is too high. Not because they're actually "thinking about it."<br><br>
    <strong>Because you didn't find out what they're really concerned about.</strong>
</div>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🧠 WHAT "I'LL THINK ABOUT IT" ACTUALLY MEANS</h2>
<p>When a customer says "I'll think about it," they're usually saying one of these things:</p>

<h3>Translation #1: "I'm not sure this is worth the price"</h3>
<p>They like it, but they're not convinced the value justifies the cost. They need more anchoring to the benefit, not more features.</p>

<h3>Translation #2: "I need to ask someone"</h3>
<p>Spouse, parent, friend. They're not the final decision-maker, but they don't want to admit it. (Especially men buying clothes—often need approval but won't say it.)</p>

<h3>Translation #3: "Something's not quite right, but I don't want to be rude"</h3>
<p>Could be fit, color, style, quality concern. They'd rather exit politely than voice a complaint.</p>

<h3>Translation #4: "I want to compare prices elsewhere"</h3>
<p>They're checking if you're the cheapest option. They won't admit this because it sounds cheap.</p>

<h3>Translation #5: "I'm actually just browsing and you pressured me"</h3>
<p>You pushed too hard, too fast. Now they're using "I'll think about it" to escape the conversation.</p>

<p><strong>Your job:</strong> Figure out which one it is. You can't solve a problem you don't understand.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>✅ WHAT TO DO INSTEAD</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Acknowledge Without Surrendering</h3>
<p><strong>Don't say:</strong> "Okay, let me know if you need anything." ❌<br>
This ends the conversation. You've accepted defeat.</p>
<p><strong>Don't say:</strong> "But wait—this is really great!" ❌<br>
Desperation repels. Pushiness kills trust.</p>
<p><strong>Instead, say:</strong> "That's totally fair. Can I ask—what's making you want to think it over?"</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Acknowledges their boundary ("that's fair")</li>
    <li>Asks permission to probe ("can I ask")</li>
    <li>Open-ended question ("what's making you...")</li>
    <li>Doesn't assume the problem (lets them tell you)</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Step 2: Listen to What They Say (and Don't Say)</h3>

<p><strong>If they say:</strong> "I just need to think about it."<br>
<strong>What they mean:</strong> They're not ready to tell you the real reason yet.</p>
<p><strong>Your move:</strong> Offer a specific guess (gives them permission to agree).</p>
<p>"I totally get it. Is it the price, or is it more about finding the right fit?"</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> You've named two common concerns. If it's one of those, they'll often admit it: "Yeah, the price is a bit more than I was expecting." Now you can address it.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p><strong>If they say:</strong> "I need to check with my wife/husband."<br>
<strong>What they mean:</strong> They're not the decision-maker (and that's okay).</p>
<p><strong>Your move:</strong> Make it easy for them to come back or include the other person.</p>
<p>"Makes sense! Do you want to take a photo to show them? Or I can hold this for you until tomorrow if you want to come back together."</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> You're helping them, not trapping them. They'll appreciate the flexibility—and they're more likely to return.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p><strong>If they say:</strong> "I want to check a few other places first."<br>
<strong>What they mean:</strong> They're price shopping (or quality comparing).</p>
<p><strong>Your move:</strong> Anchor them to what makes this product worth it.</p>
<p>"For sure. Just so you have something to compare—this one has [specific benefit they cared about]. Most people end up coming back to this one because [reason]. But definitely check around!"</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> You're planting a seed. When they see cheaper versions that don't have that feature, they'll remember why this one costs more. You sound helpful, not desperate.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p><strong>If they say:</strong> "I'm just not sure it's what I'm looking for."<br>
<strong>What they mean:</strong> Something's off, but they're being polite.</p>
<p><strong>Your move:</strong> Ask what's missing.</p>
<p>"What would make it perfect for you?"</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> They might tell you: "I wish it came in black" or "I was hoping for something a bit more fitted." Now you can show them alternatives. Or you might discover they need something totally different—and you can help them find that instead of losing them entirely.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Step 3: Bridge to an Action (Not a Sale)</h3>
<p>Once you understand the real objection, don't push for the sale. <strong>Bridge to a smaller action.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If price is the concern:</strong><br>
"Want me to show you one other option that's in a lower range but still really solid?"</p>
<p><strong>If they need approval:</strong><br>
"Want me to set this aside for 24 hours while you check with them? No obligation."</p>
<p><strong>If they're comparing:</strong><br>
"I'll be here until 7pm if you want to come back after you've looked around. Just ask for me."</p>
<p><strong>If something's off:</strong><br>
"Let me show you [alternative]. This one might be closer to what you're picturing."</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Low-pressure (not forcing the sale)</li>
    <li>Helpful (solving their problem)</li>
    <li>Keeps the door open (they don't disappear forever)</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>💬 WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IN ACTION</h2>

<h3>Scenario 1: Price Concern</h3>
<p>Customer: "Let me think about it."</p>
<p>You: "That's totally fair. Can I ask—is it the price, or just not sure it's the right fit?"</p>
<p>Customer: "Yeah… ₦35,000 is more than I was expecting to spend."</p>
<p>You: "I hear you. What were you thinking price-wise?"</p>
<p>Customer: "Probably around ₦25K."</p>
<p>You: "Got it. So for ₦25K, you're not going to get [feature they cared about]. But I do have something at ₦28K that still has [key benefit]. Want to see that one?"</p>
<p>Customer: "Sure, let's take a look."</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong> You didn't defend the ₦35K price. You met them where they are and showed a real alternative. Even if they don't buy the ₦28K version, you kept the conversation going—and sometimes they realize the ₦35K was worth it after seeing the downgrade.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Scenario 2: Need Approval</h3>
<p>Customer: "I need to check with my wife first."</p>
<p>You: "Makes total sense. Do you want to take a photo to show her? Or I can hold it here for you until tomorrow if you want to come back together."</p>
<p>Customer: "Can you hold it? I'll bring her by tomorrow."</p>
<p>You: "Absolutely. I'm here until 7pm tomorrow—just ask for me. What's your name?"</p>
<p>Customer: "David."</p>
<p>You: "Perfect, David. I'll have it ready for you."</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong> You didn't trap them ("Buy it now!"). You made it easy to return. You got their name (now it's personal). And you gave them a specific time window (creates urgency without pressure).</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Scenario 3: Something's Off</h3>
<p>Customer: "I'm just not sure."</p>
<p>You: "What would make it perfect for you?"</p>
<p>Customer: "I don't know… I guess I was hoping for something less flashy. This logo feels big."</p>
<p>You: "Ah, got it. You want something more low-key. Let me show you this one—same quality, but the branding is way more subtle."</p>
<p>Customer: "Oh yeah, this is more my style."</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong> They didn't want to say "I don't like the logo" because it sounds critical. But when you asked what would be perfect, they told you. Now you're showing them what they actually want instead of watching them leave.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🚧 COMMON MISTAKES</h2>
<p><strong>Mistake 1: Letting them go too easily</strong><br>
"Okay, no problem!" is not a strategy. At least try to understand what's holding them back. You're not being pushy—you're being helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 2: Defending the product</strong><br>
When they say "I'll think about it," they don't need you to tell them again why it's great. They need you to understand their hesitation.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 3: Offering a discount unprompted</strong><br>
"I can give you 10% off if you buy today!" sounds desperate. Only discount if they explicitly say price is the issue—and even then, try showing a lower-priced alternative first.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 4: Trapping them</strong><br>
"But you said you needed running shoes! This is perfect for you!" feels like an interrogation. They'll say anything to escape. Give them space, but keep the door open.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 5: Taking it personally</strong><br>
They're not rejecting you. They're making a decision about a product. Stay curious, not defensive.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🎯 YOUR PRACTICE TODAY</h2>
<p><strong>Today, pick 3 customers who say "I'll think about it" and use the 3-step framework:</strong></p>

<h3>Step 1: Acknowledge</h3>
<p>"That's totally fair. Can I ask—what's making you want to think it over?"</p>

<h3>Step 2: Probe</h3>
<p>Listen to their answer. If they're vague, offer specific guesses:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"Is it the price, or just not sure it's right?"</li>
    <li>"Do you need to check with someone first?"</li>
    <li>"Is something about it not quite what you're looking for?"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Bridge to a smaller action</h3>
<p>Don't push for the sale. Offer help:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Show an alternative</li>
    <li>Hold the item for them</li>
    <li>Let them take a photo</li>
    <li>Suggest coming back later</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>End of day:</strong> How many came back? How many bought something else instead? How many at least stayed in the conversation longer than usual?</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>📊 MEASURING SUCCESS</h2>
<p>By the end of this week, you should:</p>
<ul>
    <li>✅ Be probing gently when customers say "I'll think about it" (instead of just letting them go)</li>
    <li>✅ Discover at least 3 real objections behind "I'll think about it" (price, approval, comparison shopping, etc.)</li>
    <li>✅ Keep 2-3 customers engaged who would have otherwise walked out</li>
    <li>✅ Get comfortable asking "What's making you want to think it over?" without feeling pushy</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🧠 WHY THIS WORKS</h2>
<p><strong>"I'll think about it" is not a dead end. It's a door.</strong></p>
<p>Most staff hear "I'll think about it" and give up. They think they're being respectful by not pushing.</p>
<p>But here's the truth: <strong>Customers who leave without buying rarely come back.</strong></p>
<p>If you let them go without understanding their concern, you've:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lost the sale</li>
    <li>Lost the chance to help them</li>
    <li>Trained them to use "I'll think about it" as an escape hatch every time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But if you probe—gently, curiously, helpfully—you might discover:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>They actually wanted something slightly different (you can show them that)</li>
    <li>They need approval (you can make it easy for them to return)</li>
    <li>They're price shopping (you can anchor them to value)</li>
    <li>They felt pressured (you can give them space and rebuild trust)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>One luxury retail manager said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>"When they say 'I'll think about it,' that's your real job starting. Most staff think that's the end. It's not. That's the beginning of the actual sale."</blockquote>
<p><strong>The secret:</strong> You're not convincing them. You're uncovering what they need to convince themselves.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🔥 ADVANCED TIP: The Exit Offer</h2>
<p>If they're truly leaving after you've probed—one last move:</p>
<p>"No problem! Before you go—here's my card. If you have any questions later, just text me. I'm here until [time]."</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>You're giving them a reason to remember you (personal connection)</li>
    <li>You're making it easy to follow up (text, not call)</li>
    <li>You're showing confidence (you're helpful, not desperate)</li>
    <li>They might text you later that night: "Is that item still available?"</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>15-20% of people who leave will text you within 24 hours</strong> if you give them a direct line. That's better than 0% return rate.</p>

<h2>🎭 REAL EXAMPLE: Jewelry Retail</h2>
<p>High-end jewelry store in Lagos. Customer looking at ₦180,000 bracelet.</p>
<p>Customer: "I need to think about it."</p>
<p>Staff: "Of course. Can I ask—is it about the design, or is it the price?"</p>
<p>Customer: "It's beautiful. I just… I don't know if I should spend that much."</p>
<p>Staff: "I hear you. Is this for yourself or a gift?"</p>
<p>Customer: "For myself. Just a treat."</p>
<p>Staff: "Then you deserve something you love. But if ₦180K feels like a stretch, I have this one at ₦120K that has the same vibe—just simpler. Want to see?"</p>
<p>Customer: "Yeah, show me."</p>
<p>[Tries on ₦120K version]</p>
<p>Customer: "You know what… I actually like the first one better. I'm going to do it."</p>
<p><strong>What happened?</strong> The staff showed her a cheaper option—but that made her realize the ₦180K one was worth it. She wasn't rejecting the product. She was testing whether she was being frivolous. Once she saw the downgrade, she knew the upgrade was right.</p>
<p><strong>This happens all the time.</strong> Showing a cheaper option often sells the expensive one.</p>

    <strong>📋 QUICK REFERENCE: The 3-Step "I'll Think About It" Framework</strong><br><br>
    <strong>Step 1: ACKNOWLEDGE</strong><br>
    "That's totally fair. Can I ask—what's making you want to think it over?"<br><br>
    <strong>Step 2: PROBE</strong><br>
    Listen. If vague, offer guesses:<br>
    • "Is it the price, or just not sure it's right?"<br>
    • "Do you need to check with someone?"<br>
    • "Is something about it not what you're looking for?"<br><br>
    <strong>Step 3: BRIDGE</strong><br>
    Don't push for sale. Offer help:<br>
    • Show alternative<br>
    • Hold item for them<br>
    • Suggest taking photo<br>
    • Give card: "Text me if you have questions"<br><br>
    <strong>Remember:</strong> 9/10 who leave don't return. Your job is to keep them engaged, not to trap them.
</div>

<div class="tip">
    <strong>💡 Quick Tip:</strong> If they say "I'll think about it" twice (after you've probed once), let them go gracefully. Pushing harder damages trust. Give your card, smile, and let them leave. Some battles aren't worth fighting.
