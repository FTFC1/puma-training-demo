# Session Packet: VSL Redesign + Landing Page

**Session Date:** 2025-01-31
**Project:** PUMA Training Demo (Forje Retail)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Summary

Simplified the VSL video and restructured `course-outline.html` as the primary landing page for cleaner demo presentation.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. VSL Video Simplified

```
BEFORE: 20 sec, 7 scenes
  Hook → Problem → Solution → CustomerSays → Basket → Credibility → CTA

AFTER: 10 sec, 1 scene
  "Try it now" + animated basket game (taps, transitions, feedback)
```

**Video specs:** 10 seconds, 1.2 MB

### 2. Placeholder Screenshots Fixed

Two scenes had `01-landing.png` which showed "PUMA PRODUCT IMAGE" placeholder text (looked like wireframe):

| Scene | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Solution | `01-landing.png` | `02-customer-says-start.png` |
| CTA | `01-landing.png` | `06-basket-question.png` |

### 3. Phone Scale Consistency

CTA scene had smaller phone (scale 1.2) than other scenes (1.4). Fixed to match:
- `CTA.tsx`: `scale={1.2}` → `scale={1.4}`

### 4. Video Player Changes (index.html)

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Autoplay | No | Yes (muted) |
| Loop | No | Yes |
| Play overlay | Center play button | Removed |
| Replay | Overlay after end | Static corner ↻ button |
| Poster | `01-landing.png` | `06-basket-question.png` |

### 5. Course Outline → Landing Page

`course-outline.html` restructured as main landing page:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ FORJE RETAIL TRAINING          [Demo]  │
│                                        │
│ TRY THE GAMES    tap any tile to try   │
│ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐               │

├────────────────────────────────────────│
│      [PUMA Lekki course content]       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Above the fold:**
- Full viewport height (`min-height: calc(100vh - 96px)`)
- Demo tiles in 2x2 grid
- "tap any tile to try" hint (right of label)
- Bouncing ↓ scroll indicator

**Below the fold:** Full PUMA Lekki course (starting from pill badge)

### 6. Back Buttons Updated

All games/lessons changed:
- From: `"← Back to Demo" → index.html`
- To: `"← Back" → course-outline.html`

Files affected: `puma-*-game.html`, `lesson-*.html`, `mission-*.html`

### 7. Repo Cleanup

Added `.gitignore` for:
- `vsl-frames/` (debug frame exports)
- `vsl/node_modules/`

---

## Files Modified

| `vsl/src/scenes/Solution.tsx` | Screenshot: 01 → 02 |
| `vsl/src/scenes/CTA.tsx` | Screenshot: 01 → 06, scale: 1.2 → 1.4 |

## Technical Details

### Video Animation Timing (10s = 300 frames @ 30fps)
```
Frame 0-20:   "Try it now" text fades in
Frame 10-30:  Phone springs in
Frame 60-90:  Tap indicator 1, transition to building screenshot
Frame 150-180: Tap indicator 2, transition to feedback screenshot
Frame 240-260: URL appears at bottom
```

### CSS Notes
- Demo section: flexbox column, `margin-top: auto` pushes content down
- Full viewport: `min-height: calc(100vh - 96px)`
- Scroll indicator: `@keyframes bounce` with `translateY(4px)`
- Sample Lesson tile: different background `#e5dcd3`
- Label row: `display: flex; justify-content: space-between`

### Debugging
- Used FFmpeg to extract frames: `ffmpeg -i forje-vsl.mp4 -vf "fps=1" vsl-frames/frame_%02d.png`
- Cache-bust versions: ?v=4 through ?v=9

## User Context

> "rest you will do text and motion design replace"

Full VSL with all scenes (Hook, Problem, Solution, etc.) deferred - user will handle text/motion design later. Current video is simplified demo-only version.

> "i think its a simpler page to navigate to"

User prefers `course-outline.html` as entry point over `index.html` (video landing).

---

## Next Steps (if continuing)

- [ ] Text and motion design for full VSL (user to handle)
- [ ] Consider making `course-outline.html` the index page
- [ ] Add analytics/tracking for demo engagement
