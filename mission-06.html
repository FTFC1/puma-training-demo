<h1>Mission 6: Exit Protocol</h1>
<div class="meta">
    ⏱️ Time: 6-8 minutes &nbsp;|&nbsp; 🎯 How to capture customer information so non-buyers can become future buyers
</div>

<h2>⚠️ THE PROBLEM</h2>
<p>Customer spent 20 minutes with you. You did everything right:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Great questions ✅</li>
    <li>Perfect recommendations ✅</li>
    <li>Handled their objections ✅</li>
</ul>
<p>But they're leaving without buying.</p>
<p>Most staff do one of two things:</p>
<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Let them go silently<br>
"Okay, thanks for coming in!"<br>
Customer leaves. You never see them again.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Desperate last-ditch push<br>
"Are you sure? I can hold it for you! We have a sale next week!"<br>
Customer speed-walks out to escape the pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Both options lose the sale permanently.</strong></p>
<p>But there's a third option: <strong>The Exit Protocol.</strong></p>
<p>Capture their information. Stay in touch. Turn today's browser into tomorrow's buyer.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>💰 WHY THIS COSTS YOU SALES</h2>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> 60-70% of customers who browse don't buy on the first visit.</p>
<p>But here's what most stores don't track:</p>
<p><strong>Of customers who leave without buying:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>30-40% would buy later (if you follow up)</li>
    <li>20-25% come back within 7 days (if reminded)</li>
    <li>15-20% buy when the item goes on sale (if you notify them)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But if you don't capture their information, you can't follow up.</strong></p>

<div class="highlight">
    <strong>Lost opportunity calculation:</strong><br>
    • 10 browsers/day leave without buying<br>
    • 4 would buy later (40%)<br>
    • 4 × ₦25,000 average basket = ₦100,000/day lost<br>
    • ₦100,000 × 6 days = ₦600,000/week<br>
    • <strong>₦31.2M/year</strong> in recoverable sales you're losing by not capturing leads<br><br>
    <strong>Your store is leaking future buyers every single day.</strong>
</div>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🧠 WHY CUSTOMERS LEAVE WITHOUT BUYING (AND WHY THEY'LL BUY LATER)</h2>

<h3>Reason #1: Timing</h3>
<p>They like it, but they're not ready to buy today. Maybe they:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Just got paid and need to wait until next payday</li>
    <li>Want to check with someone first</li>
    <li>Are comparing options across stores</li>
    <li>Need time to think (legitimately)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Follow-up opportunity:</strong> Text them in 3-5 days: "Hey [name], just checking in—still interested in those running shoes we looked at?"</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Reason #2: Budget</h3>
<p>They love it, but it's outside their budget right now.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up opportunity:</strong> Notify them when it goes on sale or when similar items at lower price points arrive.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Reason #3: Not the Perfect Match</h3>
<p>They liked what you showed, but something was slightly off (color, fit, size out of stock).</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up opportunity:</strong> Text them when the right color/size arrives: "Hi [name], those black track pants you wanted just came in!"</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Reason #4: Overwhelmed</h3>
<p>Too many choices. Decision fatigue. They need space.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up opportunity:</strong> Send a narrowed-down recommendation: "Hey [name], thought about our conversation—this one is probably your best bet."</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>✅ WHAT TO DO INSTEAD: THE EXIT PROTOCOL</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Acknowledge Their Decision (No Pressure)</h3>
<p><strong>Don't say:</strong> "Are you sure you don't want it?" ❌<br>
(Sounds desperate, creates awkwardness)</p>
<p><strong>Don't say:</strong> Nothing (just let them leave) ❌<br>
(Missed opportunity—they might buy later)</p>
<p><strong>Instead, say:</strong> "No problem! Before you go—can I grab your name and number? If we get new stock or if this goes on sale, I'll let you know."</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>No pressure (they're leaving anyway)</li>
    <li>Clear benefit to them (you'll update them on sales/stock)</li>
    <li>Low commitment ask (just name + number, not full interrogation)</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Step 2: Capture Key Information</h3>
<p><strong>Minimum information to capture:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Name</strong> (first name is enough)</li>
    <li><strong>Phone number</strong> (WhatsApp is best in Nigeria)</li>
    <li><strong>What they were looking for</strong> (running shoes, hoodie, gym bag, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Optional but helpful:</strong></p>
<ol start="4">
    <li><strong>Size</strong> (so you can notify when their size is back in stock)</li>
    <li><strong>Budget range</strong> (so you can suggest alternatives in their price range)</li>
    <li><strong>Why they didn't buy today</strong> (too expensive, wrong color, need to think, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How to capture it:</strong></p>
<p>"Let me grab your info real quick—what's your name?"</p>
<p>[They tell you]</p>
<p>"And your number? I'll shoot you a text if this goes on sale."</p>
<p>[They give number]</p>
<p>"Perfect. And just so I know what to look out for—what size were you looking for?"</p>
<p><strong>Write it down immediately</strong> (in your phone, notebook, or store CRM system).</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Step 3: Set Expectations for Follow-Up</h3>
<p><strong>Don't say:</strong> "I'll call you later." ❌<br>
(Vague, sounds like you'll pester them)</p>
<p><strong>Instead, say:</strong> "I'll text you if [specific trigger]. If you don't hear from me in the next week, it means nothing came in—but feel free to reach out anytime."</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Specific trigger (sale, new stock, right color arrives)</li>
    <li>Time-bound (1 week, not "someday")</li>
    <li>Gives them control ("feel free to reach out")</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of specific triggers:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>"I'll text you if these go on sale."</li>
    <li>"I'll let you know when the black version comes in."</li>
    <li>"I'll reach out if we get more size 42s."</li>
    <li>"I'll message you if something similar in your budget arrives."</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Step 4: The Soft Exit Line</h3>
<p>After you've captured their info, end on a warm note:</p>
<p>"Sounds good! I'm [your name], by the way. Nice meeting you."</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Personal (they know your name now—less transactional)</li>
    <li>Friendly (warm goodbye, not "hope you buy something")</li>
    <li>Opens the door for future relationship (not one-off interaction)</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>💬 WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IN ACTION</h2>

<h3>Scenario 1: Budget Constraint</h3>
<p>Customer: "I love these, but I can't do ₦35K right now. I'll think about it."</p>
<p>You: "No problem! Can I grab your name and number? If these go on sale, I'll let you know."</p>
<p>Customer: "Oh, sure. I'm Tunde. 0803-XXX-XXXX."</p>
<p>You: "Perfect, Tunde. If we get a discount on these in the next week or two, I'll shoot you a text. And if you change your mind, just ask for me—my name's Chidi."</p>
<p>Customer: "Cool, thanks!"</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong> You captured his info, set a clear trigger (sale notification), made it personal (exchanged names). If those shoes go on sale, Tunde will buy—because you made it easy for him.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Scenario 2: Wrong Size</h3>
<p>Customer: "I really wanted these in 43, but you only have 42."</p>
<p>You: "Let me grab your info—when 43 comes in, I'll let you know."</p>
<p>Customer: "That'd be great."</p>
<p>You: "What's your name?"</p>
<p>Customer: "Amara."</p>
<p>You: "And your number, Amara?"</p>
<p>Customer: "0812-XXX-XXXX."</p>
<p>You: "Perfect. I'll text you as soon as size 43 arrives. Should be next week."</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong> You turned an out-of-stock situation into a future sale. Amara would have gone to another store. Now she's waiting for your text.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Scenario 3: Comparing Options</h3>
<p>Customer: "I'm looking at a few places. I'll let you know."</p>
<p>You: "For sure. Before you go—what's your name?"</p>
<p>Customer: "Segun."</p>
<p>You: "Segun, cool. Can I grab your number? If this one goes on sale before you decide, I'll shoot you a text."</p>
<p>Customer: "Okay, 0906-XXX-XXXX."</p>
<p>You: "Got it. And just so I know—what were you thinking budget-wise? If something similar in a lower range comes in, I can let you know."</p>
<p>Customer: "Around ₦20-25K."</p>
<p>You: "Perfect. I'll keep an eye out. My name's Bola, by the way."</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong> Segun is comparison shopping. He might find something cheaper—or he might not. Either way, you're staying on his radar. When he doesn't find what he wants elsewhere, he'll text you back.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🚧 COMMON MISTAKES</h2>
<p><strong>Mistake 1: Asking for too much information</strong><br>
"Can I get your name, number, email, Instagram, address, and what size you usually wear in every brand?"</p>
<p><strong>What you just did:</strong> Turned a simple ask into an interrogation. They'll say no. Keep it minimal—name and number are enough.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p><strong>Mistake 2: Not explaining why you need their info</strong><br>
"Can I get your number?"</p>
<p><strong>What they think:</strong> "Why? Are you going to spam me?"</p>
<p><strong>What you should say:</strong> "Can I get your number? I'll text you if this goes on sale."</p>
<p><strong>Now they understand the benefit.</strong></p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p><strong>Mistake 3: Promising vague follow-up</strong><br>
"I'll let you know if anything happens."</p>
<p><strong>What they think:</strong> "Yeah, sure you will."</p>
<p><strong>What you should say:</strong> "I'll text you if these go on sale this month. If you don't hear from me by [date], nothing came up."</p>
<p><strong>Specific > vague.</strong></p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p><strong>Mistake 4: Not following up</strong><br>
You captured their info… and never texted them.</p>
<p><strong>What you just did:</strong> Wasted the entire Exit Protocol. They gave you their number for a reason. Use it.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p><strong>Mistake 5: Following up too aggressively</strong><br>
Day 1: "Hey, still interested?"<br>
Day 2: "Just checking in!"<br>
Day 3: "We have other options!"</p>
<p><strong>What you just did:</strong> Became a pest. They'll block you.</p>
<p><strong>Follow up once within 3-7 days. If they don't respond, let it go.</strong></p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🎯 YOUR PRACTICE TODAY</h2>
<p><strong>Today, capture information from 3 customers who leave without buying:</strong></p>

<h3>Step 1: Acknowledge their decision</h3>
<p>"No problem! Before you go—can I grab your name and number?"</p>

<h3>Step 2: Capture key info</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Number</li>
    <li>What they were looking for</li>
    <li>Why they didn't buy (budget, size, color, timing)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Set expectations</h3>
<p>"I'll text you if [specific trigger] in the next [timeframe]."</p>

<h3>Step 4: Warm exit</h3>
<p>"I'm [your name], by the way. Nice meeting you!"</p>

<p><strong>End of day:</strong> How many people gave you their info? How did it feel? Did anyone seem relieved you were staying in touch?</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>📊 MEASURING SUCCESS</h2>
<p>By the end of this week, you should:</p>
<ul>
    <li>✅ Capture contact info from 10-15 non-buyers (name + number + need)</li>
    <li>✅ Feel comfortable asking for info without being pushy</li>
    <li>✅ Follow up with at least 3-5 of them (text them when trigger happens)</li>
    <li>✅ Convert 1-2 non-buyers into buyers through follow-up</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight">
    <strong>If you convert even 2 non-buyers/week through follow-up, that's:</strong><br>
    • 2 × ₦25,000 = ₦50,000/week<br>
    • ₦50,000 × 52 weeks = <strong>₦2.6M/year</strong> in recovered sales<br><br>
    <strong>Just from texting people you would have lost forever.</strong>
</div>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🧠 WHY THIS WORKS</h2>
<p><strong>Most stores treat non-buyers as dead ends. But retail isn't one-and-done.</strong></p>
<p>Customers who leave without buying aren't rejecting you. They're:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Waiting for the right timing</li>
    <li>Waiting for the right price</li>
    <li>Waiting for the right option</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your job: Stay on their radar until the right moment arrives.</strong></p>
<p>One retail manager described it like this:</p>
<blockquote>"We used to think: customer leaves = lost sale. Now we think: customer leaves = lead captured. Our follow-up texts convert 30-35% of non-buyers within 2 weeks. That's revenue we didn't even know we were losing."</blockquote>
<p><strong>The secret:</strong> You're not pestering them. You're providing a service (notifying them when what they want becomes available).</p>
<p><strong>Customers appreciate it.</strong> They gave you their number for a reason.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🔥 ADVANCED TIP: The "I'll Hold It" Offer</h2>
<p>If a customer is on the fence (not a hard no, just hesitating), offer to hold the item:</p>
<p>"Want me to hold this for you until tomorrow? No obligation—if you change your mind, no worries."</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Creates soft commitment (they know you're expecting them back)</li>
    <li>Takes pressure off (they can leave and think)</li>
    <li>Increases return rate (they feel guilty if they don't at least come back to tell you)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>30-40% of "hold it" customers return and buy within 24-48 hours.</strong></p>
<p>Even if they don't buy, you've captured their name and number when you tagged the hold item.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🎭 REAL EXAMPLE: Footwear Store</h2>
<p>Customer trying on ₦42,000 sneakers. Loves them. Says "I need to think about it."</p>
<p>Staff: "No problem! Can I grab your name and number? If these go on sale, I'll let you know."</p>
<p>Customer: "Sure. I'm Chioma. 0813-XXX-XXXX."</p>
<p>Staff: "Perfect, Chioma. And what size were you looking at?"</p>
<p>Chioma: "38."</p>
<p>Staff: "Got it. I'll text you if we get a discount on size 38s. I'm Ada, by the way."</p>
<p>[5 days later, store has 15% off promotion]</p>
<p>Ada texts: "Hi Chioma! Ada from [store]. Those sneakers you liked (size 38) are 15% off this week—₦35,700 instead of ₦42K. Let me know if you want me to hold a pair."</p>
<p>Chioma: "Yes! I'll come by tomorrow."</p>
<p>[Chioma buys]</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Ada captured info with clear trigger (sale notification)</li>
    <li>Ada followed up when trigger happened (sale started)</li>
    <li>Ada personalized the message (specific size, specific price)</li>
    <li>Chioma bought something she was already interested in—just needed the right price</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ada turned a lost sale into ₦35,700 in revenue with one text message.</strong></p>

<h2>📱 FOLLOW-UP BEST PRACTICES</h2>

<h3>When to Follow Up:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>3-5 days after visit</strong> if no specific trigger (gentle check-in)</li>
    <li><strong>Immediately</strong> if their trigger happens (sale starts, item restocked)</li>
    <li><strong>7-10 days</strong> if they mentioned coming back but didn't (soft nudge)</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Follow Up (Text Templates):</h3>
<p><strong>Sale notification:</strong><br>
"Hi [name]! [Your name] from [store]. Those [item] you looked at are on sale this week—[discount]. Let me know if you want me to hold one!"</p>
<p><strong>Restock notification:</strong><br>
"Hi [name], this is [your name] from [store]. Those [item] in [size/color] you wanted just came back in stock. Want me to set one aside?"</p>
<p><strong>General check-in:</strong><br>
"Hey [name], [your name] from [store]. Just checking in—still looking for [item]? Let me know if I can help!"</p>
<p><strong>New arrival:</strong><br>
"Hi [name], [your name] from [store]. We just got in [similar item to what they wanted] in your price range. Want to see a pic?"</p>

<h3>When NOT to Follow Up:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>They explicitly said "don't contact me"</li>
    <li>They didn't respond to your first follow-up (let it go)</li>
    <li>It's been more than 2 weeks (lead is cold)</li>
</ul>
