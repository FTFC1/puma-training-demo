<h1>Mission 5: "It's Too Expensive"</h1>
<div class="meta">
    ⏱️ Time: 8-10 minutes &nbsp;|&nbsp; 🎯 How to handle price objections without discounting (and when premium pricing actually helps you sell)
</div>

<h2>⚠️ THE PROBLEM</h2>
<p>Customer finds exactly what they want. Perfect fit. Love the style. Right color.</p>
<p>Then they look at the price tag.</p>
<p>Their face changes.</p>
<p><strong>"This is ₦45,000? That's too expensive."</strong></p>
<p>You panic. You want to save the sale. So you say:</p>
<p>"I can give you 10% off if you buy today."</p>
<p>Customer still hesitates. Leaves anyway.</p>
<p><strong>What just happened?</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>You trained them that your prices are negotiable (they'll always ask for discounts now)</li>
    <li>You made the product seem less valuable (if you can discount 10%, was it ever worth full price?)</li>
    <li>You didn't address the real issue (they don't see why it's worth ₦45K)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Price objections aren't about the number. They're about perceived value.</strong></p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>💰 WHY THIS COSTS YOU SALES (AND MARGIN)</h2>
<p>Let's say you discount 10% on every "it's too expensive" objection:</p>

<div class="highlight">
    <strong>Daily discount damage:</strong><br>
    • 3 customers/day ask for discount<br>
    • You give 10% off ₦30,000 average basket = ₦3,000 margin lost/sale<br>
    • 3 sales × ₦3,000 = <strong>₦9,000/day</strong> in margin given away<br>
    • ₦9,000 × 6 days = ₦54,000/week<br>
    • <strong>₦2.8M/year in margin</strong> you didn't need to sacrifice
</div>

<p><strong>But it's worse than that:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Training effect:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Word spreads: "If you ask for discount, they'll give it"</li>
    <li>Now 5 customers/day ask (even when they'd have paid full price)</li>
    <li>₦5M/year in margin evaporated</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Devaluation effect:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Customers think: "If they can discount 10%, it was never worth the original price"</li>
    <li>Brand perception drops</li>
    <li>Premium positioning collapses</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The real cost:</strong> You're not just losing money—you're destroying your ability to charge what you're worth.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🧠 WHAT "IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE" ACTUALLY MEANS</h2>
<p>When a customer says "it's too expensive," they're usually saying one of these:</p>

<h3>Translation #1: "I don't see why it's worth this much"</h3>
<p>They don't understand the value difference between this and a cheaper version. Your job: show them.</p>

<h3>Translation #2: "It's more than I planned to spend"</h3>
<p>They came in with a budget. You showed them something above it. They like it, but need permission to spend more.</p>

<h3>Translation #3: "I can get something similar for less"</h3>
<p>They're comparing to a cheaper brand or knock-off. They don't see the quality difference yet.</p>

<h3>Translation #4: "I want a discount but don't know how to ask"</h3>
<p>They assume everything is negotiable. They're testing if you'll budge.</p>

<h3>Translation #5: "I actually can't afford this"</h3>
<p>They literally don't have the money. No amount of value justification will change that.</p>

<p><strong>Your job:</strong> Figure out which one it is—then respond accordingly.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>✅ WHAT TO DO INSTEAD</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Don't Panic, Don't Defend, Don't Discount</h3>
<p><strong>Don't say:</strong> "But it's really good quality!" ❌<br>
(Sounds defensive, not convincing)</p>
<p><strong>Don't say:</strong> "I can give you 10% off." ❌<br>
(Throws away margin before you even try)</p>
<p><strong>Don't say:</strong> "It's actually not that expensive for [brand]." ❌<br>
(Dismisses their concern, sounds condescending)</p>
<p><strong>Instead, say:</strong> "I hear you. What were you thinking price-wise?"</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Acknowledges their concern (doesn't dismiss it)</li>
    <li>Reveals their actual budget (now you know what you're working with)</li>
    <li>Keeps the conversation going (doesn't end with "okay, never mind")</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Step 2: Anchor the Value (Not the Price)</h3>
<p>Once you know their budget, re-anchor them to <strong>why this product costs what it costs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bad value anchoring (talking about the brand):</strong><br>
"Well, it's PUMA. PUMA is always premium quality."</p>
<p><strong>Good value anchoring (connecting to their specific need):</strong></p>
<p>"I totally get it. The reason this one is ₦45K instead of ₦25K is [specific benefit they cared about]. You mentioned [thing they said earlier]—this solves that. The ₦25K version doesn't."</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Customer: "₦45,000 for a hoodie? That's a lot."</p>
<p>You: "What were you thinking price-wise?"</p>
<p>Customer: "Probably ₦25-30K."</p>
<p>You: "Okay, so here's the difference. You said you wear hoodies all day for work, right? This one [hold it up] has reinforced elbows and a heavier weight fabric. Most ₦25K hoodies start pilling after 3-4 washes. This one lasts 2-3 years. You're paying ₦45K once instead of replacing a ₦25K hoodie 3 times. It's actually cheaper long-term."</p>
<p><strong>What just happened:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>You reframed price as <strong>cost per wear</strong> (not cost per item)</li>
    <li>You connected it to <strong>their specific use case</strong> (all-day wear)</li>
    <li>You compared to the <strong>cheap alternative</strong> (and showed why it fails)</li>
    <li>You made ₦45K sound like a smart investment, not an expensive splurge</li>
</ol>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Step 3: The "Show Down" Strategy</h3>
<p>If they're still hesitant, <strong>show them the cheaper option.</strong></p>
<p>"Want to see what the ₦25K version looks like? I'll show you both side by side."</p>
<p>Then physically compare:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hold both items up</li>
    <li>Point out fabric thickness, stitching quality, zipper durability</li>
    <li>Let them feel the difference</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What usually happens:</strong> They realize the ₦45K version is worth it.</p>
<p><strong>If they still choose ₦25K:</strong> You saved the sale (₦25K > ₦0). And you preserved trust (you helped them, didn't push them).</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>You're not dismissing their budget</li>
    <li>You're empowering them to make an informed decision</li>
    <li>Seeing the downgrade often makes them appreciate the upgrade</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Step 4: The Payment Reframe</h3>
<p>If they love it but truly can't afford ₦45K upfront, <strong>reframe how they're paying.</strong></p>
<p>"Just so you know, we have installment options—₦15K today, ₦15K next month, ₦15K the month after. Does that make it easier?"</p>
<p><strong>Or break it down per use:</strong></p>
<p>"If you wear this 3 times a week for a year, that's 150 wears. ₦45K ÷ 150 = ₦300 per wear. That's less than the cost of lunch."</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> ₦45,000 feels big. ₦15,000 × 3 or ₦300/wear feels manageable.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>💬 WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IN ACTION</h2>

<h3>Scenario 1: Budget Mismatch</h3>
<p>Customer: "₦35,000 for running shoes? That's too expensive."</p>
<p>You: "What were you thinking price-wise?"</p>
<p>Customer: "Maybe ₦20-25K."</p>
<p>You: "Got it. So the reason these are ₦35K—you mentioned your knees hurt, right? These have extra cushioning in the midsole that ₦20K shoes don't. Most people with knee pain who try the cheaper shoes end up returning them because they don't help. This is the one our customers with knee issues always come back for. The extra ₦10K is basically paying for pain-free running."</p>
<p>Customer: "Hmm. Okay, I see what you mean."</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong> You connected the price to their specific pain point (literally). The ₦10K premium isn't arbitrary—it's the cost of solving their knee problem.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Scenario 2: Comparison Shopping</h3>
<p>Customer: "I saw similar track pants at [other store] for ₦18,000. These are ₦28,000. What's the difference?"</p>
<p>You: "Great question. The ₦18K ones are probably polyester, right? These are a cotton-polyester blend. Way more breathable. The ₦18K ones get sweaty after 30 minutes. These don't. Also [pick up pants], check the stitching here—double-stitched seams. The ₦18K ones usually split after a few months of washing. You're paying ₦10K more for something that lasts 3x longer and feels better."</p>
<p>Customer: "Oh. Yeah, I didn't realize the difference."</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong> You educated, not defended. You didn't trash the competitor—you calmly explained the quality gap. Now the customer understands the premium.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Scenario 3: "I Want a Discount"</h3>
<p>Customer: "Can you do better on the price?"</p>
<p>You: "I don't have flexibility on pricing, but I can show you [alternative product at lower price point] if ₦45K is outside your budget. It's still solid quality, just fewer features."</p>
<p>Customer: "What's the difference?"</p>
<p>You: [Explain difference, let them decide]</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong> You didn't discount. You didn't say "no" rudely. You offered a legitimate alternative. If they buy the ₦35K version, you saved the sale. If they go back to the ₦45K version, you held your price.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h3>Scenario 4: "I Actually Can't Afford This"</h3>
<p>Customer: "I love it, but I just can't do ₦45K right now."</p>
<p>You: "Totally understand. We do installment payments—₦15K today, ₦15K next month, ₦15K after. That work better?"</p>
<p>Customer: "Oh! Yeah, that I can do."</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong> You removed the barrier (lump sum) without discounting.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🚧 COMMON MISTAKES</h2>
<p><strong>Mistake 1: Discounting immediately</strong><br>
Customer: "It's too expensive."<br>
You: "I can give you 10% off!"</p>
<p><strong>What you just did:</strong> Trained them to always ask for discounts. And you devalued your product. Never discount before you've tried value anchoring.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p><strong>Mistake 2: Getting defensive</strong><br>
Customer: "₦35K for a T-shirt? That's crazy."<br>
You: "It's PUMA! Of course it costs that much!"</p>
<p><strong>What you just did:</strong> Made them feel stupid for questioning the price. They'll leave to save face.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p><strong>Mistake 3: Comparing to luxury brands</strong><br>
"This is actually cheap compared to Nike Air Max at ₦60K."</p>
<p><strong>What you just did:</strong> Anchored them to a different tier. They weren't comparing to Nike—they were comparing to ₦20K options.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p><strong>Mistake 4: Insulting cheaper alternatives</strong><br>
"Those cheap knock-offs fall apart in a week."</p>
<p><strong>What you just did:</strong> Insulted their budget. Now it's personal. Instead, say: "The lower-priced versions don't have [feature you need], but they're fine if you don't need that."</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p><strong>Mistake 5: Over-explaining the brand</strong><br>
"PUMA has been making athletic wear since 1948, and the founder was actually the brother of the Adidas founder, and…"</p>
<p><strong>What you just did:</strong> Bored them. They don't care about brand history. They care about whether this solves their problem.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🎯 YOUR PRACTICE TODAY</h2>
<p><strong>Today, when 3 customers say "it's too expensive," follow the 4-step framework:</strong></p>

<h3>Step 1: Ask About Budget</h3>
<p>"What were you thinking price-wise?"</p>

<h3>Step 2: Anchor the Value</h3>
<p>"The reason this is [price] instead of [their budget] is [specific benefit tied to their need]."</p>

<h3>Step 3: Show the Cheaper Option (if needed)</h3>
<p>"Want to see what the [lower price] version looks like? I'll show you the difference."</p>

<h3>Step 4: Offer Payment Flexibility (if needed)</h3>
<p>"We have installment options if that makes it easier."</p>

<p><strong>End of day:</strong> How many sales did you save? How many held full price? How many chose the cheaper alternative (but still bought something)?</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>📊 MEASURING SUCCESS</h2>
<p>By the end of this week, you should:</p>
<ul>
    <li>✅ Stop discounting automatically when you hear "it's too expensive"</li>
    <li>✅ Anchor value to the customer's specific need (not generic brand talk)</li>
    <li>✅ Close at least 2-3 sales you would've lost to price objections</li>
    <li>✅ Feel confident explaining why premium products cost more (without sounding defensive)</li>
</ul>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🧠 WHY THIS WORKS</h2>
<p><strong>Here's the secret: Premium pricing is a sales tool, not a barrier.</strong></p>
<p>Customers who see high prices assume high quality. That's why luxury brands never discount—it would destroy the perception.</p>
<p>But here's what most staff don't understand: <strong>"Too expensive" is rarely about the actual money.</strong></p>
<p>It's about:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Justification ("Can I justify spending this much?")</li>
    <li>Comparison ("Is this better than the cheaper version?")</li>
    <li>Trust ("Is this actually worth it, or are you upselling me?")</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When you anchor value properly—connecting price to their specific need—you're not convincing them. You're giving them permission to buy.</strong></p>
<p>One retail director said it perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>"If a customer complains about price, they're actually interested. They wouldn't mention price if they'd already decided not to buy. Price objections are buying signals in disguise."</blockquote>
<p><strong>Your job:</strong> Help them see why the price is fair. Then let them decide.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🔥 ADVANCED TIP: The "Cost Per Use" Reframe</h2>
<p>When customers balk at price, <strong>reframe it as cost per use.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p>₦45,000 hoodie:<br>
"If you wear this twice a week for 2 years, that's 200+ wears. ₦45K ÷ 200 = ₦225 per wear. That's less than a bottle of water."</p>
<p>₦60,000 running shoes:<br>
"These last 800-1,000km. If you run 10km a week, that's 2 years of running. ₦60K ÷ 100 weeks = ₦600/week. Less than one Uber ride."</p>
<p>₦25,000 gym bag:<br>
"Most people replace cheap bags every 6 months. This one lasts 5 years. You're saving money long-term."</p>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> ₦45,000 sounds expensive. ₦225/wear sounds like a steal.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>🎭 REAL EXAMPLE: Premium Activewear</h2>
<p>Customer trying on ₦32,000 leggings.</p>
<p>Customer: "₦32,000 for leggings? I can get leggings for ₦8,000 at [market]."</p>
<p>Staff: "You absolutely can. Want to know the difference?"</p>
<p>Customer: "Sure."</p>
<p>Staff: "The ₦8K ones are thin polyester. After 3-4 washes, they go see-through when you squat. These [hold up fabric] are double-layered and squat-proof. Also, the waistband on cheap leggings rolls down during workouts. This one stays put. You're paying ₦24K more for leggings you can actually work out in without adjusting every 10 minutes."</p>
<p>Customer: "Oh. I didn't realize that."</p>
<p>Staff: "Want to try on the ₦8K version so you can feel the difference?"</p>
<p>Customer: "No, I get it. I'll take these."</p>
<p><strong>What happened:</strong> The staff didn't trash the ₦8K leggings. She calmly explained the functional difference. The customer realized ₦32K wasn't expensive—it was an investment in not flashing people at the gym.</p>
<p><strong>She held full price. No discount needed.</strong></p>

    <strong>Step 4: PAYMENT FLEXIBILITY</strong><br>
    "We have installment payments—[amount] today, [amount] next month. Does that work better?"<br><br>
    <strong>DON'T discount until you've tried all 4 steps.</strong> Most of the time, you won't need to.

<div class="tip">
    <strong>💡 Quick Tip:</strong> If a customer loves something but says "it's too expensive," ask: "If price wasn't a factor, is this the one you'd want?" If they say yes, you know the product is right—you just need to solve the payment problem (installments, showing cheaper alternative, or cost-per-use reframe).
