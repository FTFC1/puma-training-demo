# Session Packet: VSL Redesign + Landing Page

**Session Date:** 2025-01-30
**Project:** PUMA Training Demo (Forje Retail)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Summary

Simplified the VSL video and restructured the landing page for cleaner demo presentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. VSL Video Simplified
- **Before:** 20-second video with multiple scenes (Hook → Problem → Solution → Game demos → Credibility → CTA)
- **After:** 10-second focused video showing animated Build the Basket game
- Removed wireframe-like placeholder screenshots
- Added autoplay + loop
- Static corner replay button (↻)

**Video specs:**
- Duration: 10 seconds
- Size: 1.2 MB
- Content: "Try it now. 2 minutes. No signup." + animated basket game flow

### 2. Course Outline → Landing Page
`course-outline.html` restructured as main landing page:

**Above the fold:**
- FORJE RETAIL TRAINING header + Demo badge
- "Try the games" section with 4 tiles:
  - Customer Says (2 min)
  - Build the Basket (3 min)
  - The Approach (2 min)
  - Sample Lesson (5 min read)
- Subtle hints: "tap any tile to try" + scroll indicator

**Below the fold:**
- Full PUMA Lekki course content
- Modules 1-3 with lessons and games

### 3. Files Modified
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `vsl/src/ForjeVSL.tsx` | Simplified to single animated scene |
| `vsl/src/Root.tsx` | Duration: 20s → 10s |
| `index.html` | Autoplay, loop, corner replay |
| `course-outline.html` | Landing page layout |
